\title{Plot LASSO Classification Model Coefficients}
\usage{
coeff_plot(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A workflow object containing a trained LASSO model.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object that visualizes the LASSO model coefficients as a bar plot.
}
\description{
This function extracts the coefficients from a fitted LASSO classification
model contained within a workflow object, arranges them by importance, and
creates a bar plot to visualize the coefficients.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have a trained workflow named 'lasso_model'
\dontrun{
coeff_plot(lasso_model)
}
